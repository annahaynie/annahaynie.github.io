I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at University of Southern California, where I conduct research on core-collapse supernovae under the advisement of Dr. Anthony Piro as a USC-Carnegie Fellow. My work takes a forward-thinking approach by building up the necessary theoretical framework for the understanding of the physics that powers a supernova in order to prepare for the massive influx of data expected in the next decade as a new generation of telescopes comes online. This framework is crucial for understanding what data will necessary to answer broader questions about the life cycle of supernovae, and therefore providing direction for these future telescope surveys. It also provides well-calibrated models that are easily fit to data to robustly derive insights without the need to tediously numerically simulate each individual event. I am thrilled to contribute such important tools to the field and am excited to see what mysteries we will be able to uncover about the strange behavior of exploding stars. See my publications for a deeper dive into the physics behind these powerful events.

Transitioning Into the Field of Data Science 
======
I am deeply grateful for my time as an astrophysicist, but I am eager to move on to my next challenge solving problems here on Earth rather than beyond our Solar System. I am confident that the technical, problem solving, and self learning skills developed during my PhD, position me as a strong data scientist in any industry. I am working to diversify and adapt my skill set through a number of hands-on courses exploring topics in machine learning and data science such. See my portfolio for examples of projects completed, such as the detection of credit card fraud using machine learning classification algorithms.  

Science Communication 
======
I firmly believe that science is for everyone and as a society we should be striving for improved scientific literacy for all. I have participated in a number of public outreach programs to bring science to K-12 students across the country through public talks and demonstrations, virtual classroom visits, pen-pal programs, and more. Organizations that I have partnered with include [Skype-a-Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) and [Letters to a Pre-Scientist](https://prescientist.org/) and I am looking forward to continuing to work with these programs beyond my time in academia.

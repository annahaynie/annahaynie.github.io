I'm a soon-to-be former astrophysicist eager to transition into a career in data science! After spending the past six years investigating the physics behind core-collapse supernovae, I'm ready to start solving problems here on Earth. 

I've completed my PhD in physics against a backdrop of a drastically changing world and it has made me reevaluate my priorities and the types of problems I want to solve. My goal now is to leverage my technical, problem solving, and self-teaching skills developed as a graduate student to work on the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change, healthcare access and outcomes, voting rights and access, and more! I'm excited to join a company where I can be part of a dynamic team that values innovation, creativity, and passion.

With a ~4 order of magnitude increase in data collection, we're going to be observing more supernovae than ever before. In an effort to make the most of this data, I've developed analytic frameworks that are calibrated to more detailed numerical simulations and can be easily and quickly applied to large datasets to robustly derive properties of supernovae. My work is also useful for directing these future surveys as I have highlighted the crucial information that can be derived from previously poorly observed phases of supernova, including at very early (<1 day) and very late times (>200 days). Outside of work, I can be found hiking, camping, or laying in a park with my dog, Archie.

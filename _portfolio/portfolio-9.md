#[Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/annahaynie/annahaynie.github.io/blob/master/Certificates/ML.pdf)
###[Project Repository](https://github.com/annahaynie/IBM_Course/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Python)

During this course, I explored various Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning, various ML algorithms, and their use cases. To apply these tools, I completed projects predicting CO2 emission from different types of cars (linear regression), identifying credit card fraud for European cardholders (decision trees, support vector machines), predicting taxi tip amounts in New York City (regression trees), and predicting rainfall across Australia (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors).

#[Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/annahaynie/annahaynie.github.io/blob/master/Certificates/DataViz.pdf)
###[Project Repository](https://github.com/annahaynie/IBM_Course/tree/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python)

This course focused on applying visualization techniques to explain relationships between data. The final culmination of this course was building a dashboard using Dash and Plotly to visualize automobile sales statistics during recession periods in the United States. 

#[Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/annahaynie/annahaynie.github.io/blob/master/Certificates/Data%20Analysis%20With%20Python.pdf)
###[Project Repository](https://github.com/annahaynie/IBM_Course/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python)

This course focused on data wrangling, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis, which cluminated in clean, preprocessed data sets on which regression models could be trained to predict insurance costs and housing prices. 

#[Databases and SQL for Data Science](https://github.com/annahaynie/annahaynie.github.io/blob/master/Certificates/DB%26SQL.pdf)
###[Project Repository](https://github.com/annahaynie/IBM_Course/tree/main/Databases%20and%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Science)

This course provided an introduction to working with relational databases and SQL queries and allowed me to explore the relationships between public school success, socioeconomic indicators, and crime rates in the city of Chicago. 

#[Python Project for Data Science](https://github.com/annahaynie/annahaynie.github.io/blob/master/Certificates/Python_Project.pdf)
###[Project Repository](https://github.com/annahaynie/IBM_Course/tree/main/Python%20Project%20for%20Data%20Science)
Playing the role of a data scientist, in this course I scraped stock data for Tesla and GameStop to analyze historical trends in the relationship between stock price and company revenue.
